## Water hardness test {#water-hardness-test}


### Overview {#overview}

I tested with the following product of water filter, comparing to Tube water (control group).

-   BRITA Classic type
-   PearlCo


### Test environment {#test-environment}

As a environment we use a water case from PearlCo and [this reagent for water hardness](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00MEEWTBS/).

Test protocol is as follows :

-   Repeat followings for each group
    -   Fill out test tube with filtered water to 5 [ml] mark
    -   Add titration solution drop by drop the while swirling test tube
    -   Count drops until color changes from RED to GREEN
-   Since 1 drop of reagent express 1 degree dH (see the [measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard%5Fwater#Measurement)), calculate each hardness.


### Result {#result}

The following result shows color and water types.

| Drop count | Tube water                | BRITA                     | PearlCo                   |

The result shows Tube water is 14, BRITA is 8 and PealCo is 4.
According to [this Hard-soft classification table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard%5Fwater#Hard/soft%5Fclassification), each shows “Very hard”, “Hard” and “Moderately hard”.


### Conclusioin {#conclusioin}

Since I use water from the same environment, I should use PearlCo as long as I want to avoid drinking hard water.

I cannot rule out the following possibility just by this trial:
It's combination of a filter and water pot that decides effect of water filtering.

Given we express (water pot, water filter), we can show the result as (PearlCo, PearlCo) > (PearlCo, BRITA).
But it's not clear at all whether (BRITA, BRITA) > (PearlCo, PearlCo), or vice versa.

For instance, it requires your Baby's identificatin number of German citizen and Residence Permission to access following service

-   Kindergeld
-   Elterngeld
-   KITA Guteschein

Following shows actual flow from birth event to finish all conditinos.

It seems to take 3 months at least, if your original country is Japan. And bottle-neck is creating "Family Registration" record in Japan. That sounds a little bit funny.

Questions are

-   Do we need official translator of Geburtsurkunde for Birth Certificate?
-   Don't we have any easier way to finish Baby's Citizen Registration without Passport?

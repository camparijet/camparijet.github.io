* DONE introduce wifi direct between PC and Android under sshfs
  CLOSED: [2019-05-04 Sa 17:25]

  Usually I write memo in files in the storage under my Android phone.

  Previously I use usb-tethering between Android phone and PC connection.

** structure

   mount sshfs + wifi direct

   #+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file images/wifi_direct_sshfs_nexus5x.png
   note over phone: open wifi direct configuration
   pc -> phone: find wifi direct node as GO
   ...
   pc -> phone: connect to phone over wifi direct
   note over pc: "p2p_find; p2p_connect * pbc go_intent=0"
   note over phone: start sshd
   pc -> phone: sshfs
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:wifi_direct_sshfs_nexus5x.png]]

** speed test between phone and PC

   wifi direct

   So the wifi direct environment is 3~4 times slower than the wired one

** SOMEDAY sshfs brutual shutdown cause other problems
   CLOSED: [2019-04-15 Mo 11:55]

   - when you modify file which is mounted via sshfs, your editor may get stuck

   - shutdown gracefully when wifi is away

   - enable verbose log

*** behavior difference between wifi and usb
    - emacs goes hang over wifi-direct while it doesn't over USB
    - using fuse in debugging mode shows over USB also failed, it seems because background may handle signal correctly for disconnection
    - fuse logs
      - [[file:research/wifi-direct/wifi_direct_brutual_disconnect_sshfs.log][wifi]]
      - [[file:research/wifi-direct/usb_brutual_disconnect_sshfs.log][usb]]

*** tramp on termux                                             :hotfix:

    Some people say "tramp in emacs avoid this problem"

    So I tried tramp after setting the following additionally.

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin" t)
    (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/applets" t)
    #+END_SRC

    I feel this was so slow not reliable enough unfortunately.

* Job title shows mindset, not position                           :tech:
  [2018-03-14 Wed]

  Just for note. Job title is of course a position in the company, but one colleague tells a junior in his team that since companies have various structure, same name positions have various roles. So It is mind-set that is made common among the company by title.

   Berlin weather radically changes today, now 16 cel degree. It's crazy because it was -10 cel degree.

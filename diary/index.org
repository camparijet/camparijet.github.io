* Job title shows mindset, not position                           :tech:
  [2018-03-14 Wed]

  Just for note. Job title is of course a position in the company, but one colleague tells a junior in his team that since companies have various structure, same name positions have various roles. So It is mind-set that is made common among the company by title.

* Initial test                                               :emacs:org:

  Today is 7-year-anniversary for Fukushima Earthquake.
   Berlin weather radically changes today, now 16 cel degree. It's crazy because it was -10 cel degree.

* DONE [#B] design pattern of pthread
  CLOSED: [2018-03-11 Sun 21:55]
  - worker - watcher model
    - normal case
      - how watcher detects worker finishes
    - late case
      - how to kill the thread from watcher to worker

  #+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file images/pthread_design.png :cmdline "-charset UTF-8"
  core->watcher: assign job
  watcher->worker: create thread for worker and dispatch job
  watcher->watcher: monitor worker
  alt job finishes
  worker->worker: finish job
  watcher->worker: detect job finish
  else job timeout
  note over worker: (still doing job)
  watcher->worker: kill worker process
  end
  watcher->worker: join
  watcher->watcher: finish monitoring
  #+END_SRC

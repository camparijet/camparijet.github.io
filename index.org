** How to authorize my Baby to public Service in Germany

   For instance, it requires your Baby's identificatin number of German citizen and Residence Permission to access following service

   - Kindergeld
   - Elterngeld
   - KITA Guteschein

   Following shows actual flow from birth event to finish all conditinos.

   It seems to take 3 months at least, if your original country is Japan. And bottle-neck is creating "Family Registration" record in Japan. That sounds a little bit funny.

   #+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file images/en_sequence_baby_authorization.png :cmdline "-charset UTF-8"
      box "Original Country"
      participant Family
      participant "Administrative(Origin Country)" as origin
      end box

      box "Living Country"
      participant You
      participant Embassy
      participant "Administrative(Living Country)" as living
      end box

   Questions are
   - Do we need official translator of Geburtsurkunde for Birth Certificate?
   - Don't we have any easier way to finish Baby's Citizen Registration without Passport?

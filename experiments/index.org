* Water hardness test
** Overview
   I tested with the following product of water filter, comparing to Tube water (control group).

   - BRITA Classic type
   - PearlCo

** Test environment

   As a environment we use a water case from PearlCo and [[https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00MEEWTBS/][this reagent for water hardness]].

   Test protocol is as follows :

   - Repeat followings for each group
     + Fill out test tube with filtered water to 5 [ml] mark
     + Add titration solution drop by drop the while swirling test tube
     + Count drops until color changes from RED to GREEN
   - Since 1 drop of reagent express 1 degree dH (see the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_water#Measurement][measurement]]), calculate each hardness.

** Result

   The following result shows color and water types.

   | Drop count | Tube water              | BRITA                   | PearlCo                 |

   The result shows Tube water is 14, BRITA is 8 and PealCo is 4.
   According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_water#Hard/soft_classification][this Hard-soft classification table]], each shows “Very hard”, “Hard” and “Moderately hard”.


** Conclusioin
   Since I use water from the same environment, I should use PearlCo as long as I want to avoid drinking hard water.

   I cannot rule out the following possibility just by this trial:
   It's combination of a filter and water pot that decides effect of water filtering.

   Given we express (water pot, water filter), we can show the result as (PearlCo, PearlCo) > (PearlCo, BRITA).
   But it's not clear at all whether (BRITA, BRITA) > (PearlCo, PearlCo), or vice versa.
